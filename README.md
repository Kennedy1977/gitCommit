# React Developer Test

The goal of this test is to take some JSON data and build a React based GUI to make it easier for
any user to read. The main focus of this test is the code & usability.

Please use any tools/libraries which you feel necessary.

The below endpoint will return a JSON response with commits to a GitHub repo.
https://api.github.com/repositories/19438/commits

As a starting point the interface should list all the commits. How the user interacts with those
commits to see the data about each of them is for you to decide.

For each commit the following data should be accessible:
- Committers Name
• Committers Email
• Committers Avatar
• Commit Date
• Message
• Commit URL

Feel free to include any other data – an example may be a link to the committers GitHub profile.
Once completed please share a link to the code on a public repo (github etc).
